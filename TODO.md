- don't let users declare variables twice
- add types
- add features
  - calling functions
  - arrays
  - objects
  - strings -- char arrays I assume
- consider making printError a globally available function and just exit early instead of returning so many optional types
- Carry line numbers and character numbers all the way into the generator
- add && and || -- parantheses may already just work
- implement default immutable vars and add a mutable keyword (or type?)
